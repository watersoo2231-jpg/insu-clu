# Code Signing Policy

EasyClaw uses free code signing provided by [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org).

## Signed Artifacts

- **Windows**: NSIS installer (`.exe`) is signed with an EV code signing certificate issued by SignPath Foundation.
- **macOS**: DMG installer is signed and notarized through Apple Developer Program.

## Build & Signing Process

Windows installers are built and signed through the following process:

1. A GitHub Release triggers the `Build & Release` workflow.
2. The Windows job builds an unsigned installer using `electron-builder`.
3. The unsigned artifact is submitted to [SignPath](https://signpath.io) for signing.
4. SignPath verifies the artifact was built from the source repository by an authorized CI pipeline.
5. The signed installer is uploaded to the GitHub Release.

All builds are reproducible from the public source code. No binary artifacts are signed outside of the CI pipeline.
